This is the companion website to the main [BioHackrXiv preprint server](https://biohackrxiv.org/).

### About

BioHackrXiv is a preprint to report on works done during BioHackathons, CodeFests, Sprints or similar events and related to Life Sciences and Health Care domains. Articles in BioHackrXiv commonly report on-going work as a couple of days of hacking are commonly not enough to get the things fully done. However, hackathon reports should still show work that people can build upon.

One of the reasons behind BioHackathons and similar is sharing: ideas, data, designs, software, documentations and tutorials among others. We therefore kindly ask you to use CC-BY 4.0 license for your work [@CCBY4].  We also encourage you to share your code on GitHub, with an open license whenever possible.

The people behind BioHackrXiv has participated on multiple BioHackathons organized by [National Bioscience Database Center](https://biosciencedbc.jp/en/) (NBDC) / [Database Center for Life Science](http://dbcls.jp/index-en.html) (DBCLS) in Japan ([NBDC/DBCLS BioHackathon](http://biohackathon.org/)) and [ELIXIR Europe](https://elixir-europe.org/) ([ELIXIR BioHackathon](https://www.biohackathon-europe.org/)). We decided to create BioHackrXiv preprint in order to make it easier for all to share and report on the work done at this sort of events. Of course, any hacking event is welcome to publish here, the more the merrier they say! And, if you want to go for a more formal peer-reviewed publication, you can always do so once your work is more mature.
