# Moderation process

As a preprint, BioHackrXiv hols no peer-review process. We have however a basic checklist. Any submitted article will go through this checklist to decide whether it can be accepted or no. We aim to notify about submission in a lapse from 2 to 5 days.

* Article is written in English and contains a language appropriate for publication
  * We will not do a proof-reading but we will do a basic check up 
* Article complies to the [submission guidelines](./submission_guidelines)
* After a quick basic look, authors and affiliations seem to be legit
* After a quick basic look, manuscript appears to be indeed original

If the article is suitable for publication at BioHackrXiv, it will be accepted and a DOI will be assigned. Once a DOI is assigned, articles become citable and cannot longer be withdrawn.
